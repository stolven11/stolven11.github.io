One thing successful people have in common is that they win more than they lose.

You dont just get lucky and win once,
its aboutc quality and consistancy.
It happens through hours and days and weeks and maybe years of hard work.

So many people say they want it, 
but they dont.

DONT BE AFRAID OR EMBARESSED TO BE DIFFERENT.

Push yourself.
Work hard.
Become the best.

If you can take a hit in the face and get back up and learn from it, the fail turns from a lose, to a win.

Dont live in the bubble like everyone else.
Thats what I call being a drone.

Do not become a drone.

Anyone can become anything they want and do anything they want.

Theres nothing holding you back.
Create the world yourself.
Refuse to let people tell you what you cant do.

Become the master of your own destiny.

Everything happens for a reason.
You might not what at first.
Trust in yourself.
Work hard.

You are a winner.

Say this:
I will work the hardest
I will do extra work
I will go above and beyond
