<h1>Motivational Speech by Natechip (aka stolven11)</h1><br>
One thing successful people have in common is that they win more than they lose.<br>
<br>
You dont just get lucky and win once,<br>
its about quality and consistancy.<br>
It happens through hours and days and weeks and maybe years of hard work.<br>
<br>
So many people say they want it, <br>
but they dont.<br>
<br>
DONT BE AFRAID OR EMBARRASSED TO BE DIFFERENT.<br>
<br>
Push yourself.<br>
Work hard.<br>
Become the best.<br>
<br>
If you can take a hit in the face and get back up and learn from it, the fail turns from a lose, to a win.<br>
<br>
Dont live in the bubble like everyone else.<br>
Thats what I call being a drone.<br>
<br>
Do not become a drone.<br>
<br>
Anyone can become anything they want and do anything they want.<br>
<br>
Theres nothing holding you back.<br>
Create the world yourself.<br>
Refuse to let people tell you what you cant do.<br>
<br>
Become the master of your own destiny.<br>
<br>
Everything happens for a reason.<br>
You might not what at first.<br>
Trust in yourself.<br>
Work hard.<br>
<br>
You are a winner.<br>
<br>
Say this:<br>
I will work the hardest<br>
I will do extra work<br>
I will go above and beyond<br>
Exel<br>
Exel<br>
Win<br>
Best<br>
Exel<br>
Win<br>
Win<br>
I will be the best<br>
I will be stronger, better, faster, and smarter than yesterday<br>
I will be a champion<br>
I will be the greatest<br>
I will be the best<br>
I am the best<br>
EXEL<br>
EXEL<br>
EXEL<br>
EXEL<br>
I will gain strength beyond what seems possible<br>
<br>
